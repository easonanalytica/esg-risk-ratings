# üåç Geography ESG Ratings

AI-generated Geo ESG Ratings measure 213 countries or regions in terms of financially relevant factors in Environment, Socioeconomics, and Governance. With a score between 1 (risk) to 9 (opportunity), the ratings range from Risk (C-, C, C+), Neutral (B-, B, B+), to Opportunity (A-, A, A+). The ratings can be used to get a snapshot of the financial health of a country/region or conduct risk & oppotunity exposure analysis in the near term (~ 1 month).

The final scores are adjusted based on the influence of other geographies, so in the case of China or US, they both have great influence on the world due to their political & socioeconomic reach, so their score imposes greater impact on the world of ESG.
